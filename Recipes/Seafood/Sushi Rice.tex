{Sushi Rice}\label{pg:sushi_rice}

\ingredients{
2 cups glutinous white rice (sushi rice)\\ 
3 cups water\\ 
$\frac{1}{2}$ cup rice vinegar\\ 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil\\ 
$\frac{1}{4}$ cup sugar\\ 
1 teaspoon salt\\ 
}

\hint{You can also use a pressure cooker to easily prepare this and avoid the saucepan.}

\preparation{
\step Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. 
\step Combine with water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed.
\step In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. 
\step Cool the mixture, then stir into the warm cooked rice. When you pour this in to the rice it will seem very wet. Keep stirring and the rice will dry as it cools.
